# Learning Node.js

Hey in this repo I'm learning and experimenting with Node.js. I learned and made these projects with the help of a Udemy course. Feel free to check out the source code and view finished projects. 

All projects are hosted on Heroku with a free plan. This means that when they're inactive for 30 minutes the Heroku server (dyno) goes to sleep. So please wait approx 10 seconds for the site to load :)

## 1. Notes app
Starter project where you run commands (addNote, getNote, etc ...) in the terminal and node provides you with answers.

## 2. Weather app
Small project where Node.js communicates with an API to get the weather for the location you search for.

## 3. Task manager
Here I created an API that uses CRUD operations with a MongoDB database. Currently there's no UI coupled with it yet. I'm definitely planning to using these API endpoints with Vue.js and axios some time in the future!

## 4. Chat app
Node.js project with the socket.io library to create a small chat app. You can choose your username and a room to join. And node will handle all the logic to ensure the all the users in the same room can chat to eachother.
