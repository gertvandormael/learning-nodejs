# Learning Node.js

Hey in this repo I'm learning and experimenting with Node.js. Feel free to check out the source code and view finished projects. All finished projects are hosted on Heroku with a free plan. So please be patient and wait for the dyno to wake up :)

## Weather app
Small project where Node.js communicates with an API to get the weather for the location you search for. <br>
